## Article Description

Core-collapse supernovae are profuse emitters of tiny particles called
neutrinos.  We calculate how well neutrino detectors on Earth would be
able to detect a specific feature in the neutrino emission from a
nearby supernova, the "breakout burst."  For this project, I created a
Monte Carlo code to simulate detection of the breakout burst across a
variety of neutrino detector types and at a variety of supernova
distances.
