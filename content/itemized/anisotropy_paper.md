## Article Description

For my undergraduate thesis, I investigated how Lyman-alpha emission is affected by and correlated with the environment from which it is emitting.  We used a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code and basic prescriptions of anisotropy in a gas cloud's density and/or velocity and then analyzed how these environmental anisotropies affected the emission strength and frequency of the Lyman-alpha photons.
