Yesterday a graduate alumna of my department, [Ai-Lei Sun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ai-lei-sun-70306775/), hosted a meeting with graduate students and postdocs regarding her decision to transition from postdoc to a non-academic job.  She was visiting campus for reunion weekend and was kind enough to offer to do this for us. She graduated with her PhD two years ago and has been pursuing postdoc work since then.  She was sought out by the company [Orbital Insight](https://orbitalinsight.com/) with whom she had had some contact in years past and decided to work for them and make the transition out of academia.
