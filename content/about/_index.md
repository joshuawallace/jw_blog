I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Princeton University in the Department of Astrophysical Sciences. In my current research, I look for periodic signals in time series data.  The type of signals I am most interested in (transiting exoplanets) usually have low signal-to-noise ratios, so I spend a lot of time thinking about how to differentiate these signals from the noise.  Also in my Ph.D., I have developed and published on a Monte Carlo code that simulates detection of neutrinos from supernovae and have ran and analyzed results from hundreds of N-body simulations.

I have also [published a short eBook](https://www.amazon.com/Acing-School-Application-Joshua-Wallace-ebook/dp/B01CM3HZL4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527708423&sr=8-1&keywords=acing+the+grad+school+application) on how to successfully apply for graduate school.
